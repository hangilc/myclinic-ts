- Use `export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8` before running commands with Japanese text

## Test Commands
- Test command: `npm test`
- Run specific test: `npm test -- <test-file>`

## Development Notes
- This project contains Japanese text and requires proper UTF-8 handling
- When running tests or viewing output, ensure terminal supports UTF-8
